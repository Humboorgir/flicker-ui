## Flicker UI
Flicker UI is a collection of pre-made, animated React components built with Tailwindcss and Framer-motion.
This is the CLI for Flicker UI. It does the job of managing Flicker UI's components, hooks, etc in your projects.

## How it works
Get started with:
```
npx @latest flicker-ui init
```
The above command creates a config file at the project root.
Afterwards, you will be able to edit the config file if needed and the CLI would work accordingly.

To get a list of available commands, use:
```
npx @latest flicker-ui --help
```

### Note
Bear in mind that you're not required to use Flicker UI with npx. Installing it as a global package with `npm install -g flicker-ui` and then using it with `npm flicker-ui` would be just fine! However, that way you would have to update the CLI manually everytime new components and features come out.
